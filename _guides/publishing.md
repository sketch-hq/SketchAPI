Sketch plugins are listed in a GitHub repository. This document explains how to publish it there and how to allow Sketch to receive updates for your plugin.

## Publishing for the first time

Sketch plugins are listed in a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory](https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory).

To add your plugin to the list, open a PR with the information about your plugin. Once it is merged, your plugin will appear here: [https://sketchapp.com/extensions/plugins/](https://sketchapp.com/extensions/plugins/)

If you use `skpm`, the first time you publish a plugin using `skpm publish`, it will automatically create the PR for you.

## Publishing an update

From Sketch v45 onwards Sketch provides an officially supported mechanism for updating plugins within the app.

If your plugin already has its own update mechanism built into it, we encourage that you move to using the new system. This will improve the user experience, since users will be able to manage all installed plugins inside a tab in the app’s Preferences panel.

On launch, we check for updates for all installed plugins, and if there’s any, we show a badge on Sketch’s window. Clicking it will take the user to the app’s Preferences, where they’ll be able to update their plugins.

Currently Sketch only allows the user to update to the latest version. Future versions of Sketch may provide additional options for the user to select which plugin version can be downloaded and installed.

You have two solution to opt-in this update mechanism:

### 1. Using `skpm`

By running `skpm publish`, it will automatically publish the updated version of your plugin and make sure Sketch can pick it up.

### 2. Manual

There is an additional entry in the `manifest.json` file contained within your plugin bundle that you need to define for updating to work.

The entry is called `appcast`, and it is a string specifying a URL to the appcast file.

#### The `appcast.xml` file

The appcast file contains information about updates to the plugin, like the versions of available updates and where the updates can be downloaded from. Sketch downloads this file to determine if there are plugin updates available.

The Appcast conforms to the Sparkle defined appcast described in the [Sparkle Documentation](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/) and on the [Publishing an Update page](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/publishing/#publishing-an-update). For Sketch plugins, only .zip files are supported as enclosures.

The minimum and maximum system version do not refer to the version of the operating system when used for plugins. Exactly how they will be used in a later version of Sketch is still undecided.

The following Appcast example lists three different versions of the plugin. Each version has its own download link and brief description text.

### Implementing the Startup and Shutdown methods in your Plugin

If your plugin does anything that requires some initialization you should implement the `Startup` handler as part of your plugin. The same goes for implementing the `Shutdown` handler, where you should implement any cleanup code that your plugin requires.
You may have already been using these events, but with plugin updating it is more important than ever to do so.

When a plugin is updated, the version being updated will be sent the `Shutdown` action. And the new version will be sent a `Startup` action.

For example, if your plugin displays some user interface elements within Sketch, you should remove those in the `Shutdown` handler. This way, the new plugin will be able to show the updated user interface components with all of the old user interface elements having been removed.

The same goes for any persistent data that your plugin maintains. Any unsaved information should be written to disk when `Shutdown` is called.

Do not include code in the `Startup` handler that could be run later.


### Troubleshooting

So you've followed all the steps, and your plugin is still not updating? Try these:

- Remove the `PluginsWarehouse` folder that lives in `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/`. This is where we cache plugin downloads, and if you've been testing different versions of your appcast, you probably have some old stuff there that's worth cleaning.
- Make sure the `manifest.json` in your downloaded ZIP has a version number that matches the one in your appcast. If the appcast says the ZIP contains v1.2, but the actual ZIP says it's v1.1, the installation will not work.
