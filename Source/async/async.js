 * A fiber is a way to keep track of a asynchronous task. The script will stay
 * alive as long as at least one fiber is running.
 *
 * To end a fiber, call `fiber.cleanup()`. This will tell Sketch that it can
 * garbage collect the script if no other fiber is running.
 *
 * You can run a function when the fiber is about to be cleaned up by setting a
 * callback: `fiber.onCleanup(function () {...})`.
 * Always do your clean up in this function instead of doing before calling
 * `fiber.cleanup`: there might be some cases where the fiber will be cleaned
 * up by Sketch so you need to account for that.
