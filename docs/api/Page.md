| document<span class="arg-type">[Document](#document) - required</span> | The document from which you want the Symbols Page. |

#### Returns

Return a [Page](#page) or `undefined` if there is no Symbols Page yet.

### Create the Symbols Page

```javascript
var symbolsPage = Page.createSymbolsPage()
symbolsPage.parent = document
```

A method to create the Page with the name that Sketch will recognize as the Symbols Page.

### Knows if a Page is the Symbols Page

```
