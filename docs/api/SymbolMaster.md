### Returns

A new [Artboard](#artboard)

## Create a new Instance

```javascript
var instance = master.createNewInstance()
```

Creates a new [SymbolInstance](#symbol-instance) linked to this master, ready for inserting in the document.

```javascript
var instances = master.getAllInstances()
```

Returns an array of all instances of the symbol in the document, on all pages.

## Get Library defining the Symbol Master

```javascript
var originLibrary = master.getLibrary()
```

If the Symbol Master was imported from a library, the method can be used to:

- know about it
- get the library back

### Returns

The [Library](#library) the symbol was defined in, or `null` if it is a local symbol.

## Sync the local reference with the library version

```javascript
const success = master.syncWithLibrary()

If a [Library](#library) has some updates, you can synchronize the local Symbol Master with the Library's version and bypass the panel where the user chooses the updates to bring.

### Returns

`true` if it succeeded.

```javascript
const success = master.unlinkFromLibrary()
```

You can unlink a Symbol Master from the Library it comes from and make it a local Symbol Master instead. It will be added to the `Symbols` Page.
