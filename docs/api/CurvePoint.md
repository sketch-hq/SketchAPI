<!-- Contains some methods to make interacting with a point easier. -->

| Properties |  |

| curveFrom<span class="arg-type">[Point](#point)</span> | The position of the handle control point for the incoming path. |
| curveTo<span class="arg-type">[Point](#point)</span> | The position of the handle control point for the outgoing path. |

```

In case the user is currently editing a path, you can check if a curve point is selected using the `curvePoint.isSelected()` method.
