---

Sketch includes `sketchtool`, a command-line interface to integrate into your save to publish workflow. With `sketchtool` you can:

- [Export artboards, layers, slices, pages and document previews](/cli/export-assets)
- [Inspect documents](/cli/inspect-document)
- [Run plugins](/cli/run-plugin)

> **Important:** The Sketch command-line interface is free to use but requires a valid license to run plugins. `sketchtool` is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## Usage

The `sketchtool` binary is located within the Sketch application bundle.

```sh
Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS/sketchtool
```

To run `sketchtool` from anywhere on the command-line, add the cli location to `$PATH` or use a convenience script to look up the correct path using `mdfind`.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

SKETCH=$(mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier=='com.bohemiancoding.sketch3' | head -n 1)

# pass on all given arguments
"$SKETCH/Contents/MacOS/sketchtool" "$@"
```

> **Note:** `sketchtool` requires macOS 10.11 or later.

## Versioning

Each Sketch release includes its own `sketchtool`. If your application is designed to work with a specific version of Sketch, be sure to use the correct path to the command.
